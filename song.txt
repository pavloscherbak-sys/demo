Do ya really wanna
Do ya really wanna taste it!
Get it on, get it on top, make a move extreme
Make a pose, shortcut to your dreams.
Float straight to the stars on that flying thing.
Getting high, getting brave, getting snow blind
Game set, go!
Pick a tune, chick harpoon
In a world beyond
Get a beat, got a heat
On a phony string
Tear your world apart
Once the magic starts
Do ya really wanna, do ya really wanna taste it
What's going up must come down
Do ya really wanna, do ya really wanna taste it
Baby you're losing ground
